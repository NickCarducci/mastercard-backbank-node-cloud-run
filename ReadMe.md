[Cloud Run comes with a generous free tier and is pay per use, which means you only pay while a request is being handled on your container instance. (If it is idle with no traffic, then you donâ€™t pay anything).](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-build-samples/blob/main/multiple-node-versions-example/index.js)

[Because jobs should not serve requests, the container should not listen on a port or start a web server.](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/container-contract#jobs-exit)
